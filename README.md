# Employee Recognition Platfrom

It's a simple app for giving kudos to other employees. Made with Ruby on Rails. 

It's the first project from Nerds Family and Visuality academy.

As an employee, you have 10 kudos to give to other employees. You can also delete the given kudo. As an admin, you can edit and delete employee accounts and delete kudos.

### Things I learned

#### 1. Ruby on Rails
It was my first experience with Ruby on Rails. I was very curious, so I decided to take the challenge. During the first sprint, I learned the basics of the basics.
I got acquainted with:
  * getting started with RoR and making app template,
  * working with models,
  * using RoR associations,
  * writing simple integration tests.

#### 2. Bootstrap
Even though it was not part of the task, I decided to use the Bootstrap library to improve the frontend a little.

#### 3. Heroku
I wanted to make a live demo of the app, so I decided to deploy it on Heroku.
